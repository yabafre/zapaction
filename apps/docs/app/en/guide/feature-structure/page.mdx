# Feature Structure

Official ZapAction pattern:

```txt
features/
  products/
    _actions/
    _hooks/
    _queries/
    _components/
```

## Why this works

- Clear ownership by feature
- Locality for keys, tags, hooks, and UI
- Easy migration from small to large modules

## Product module example

```ts
export const productKeys = createFeatureKeys("products", {
  list: () => [],
  detail: (id: string) => [id],
});

export const productTags = createFeatureTags("products", {
  list: () => [],
  detail: (id: string) => [id],
});
```
