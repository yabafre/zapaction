# Project Setup (Recommended Structure)

Use a feature-first structure from day one.

```txt
src/
  features/
    users/
      _actions/
      _queries/
      _hooks/
      _components/
```

## Call flow

```txt
RSC Page
  -> Client Component
    -> useUsers()
      -> useActionQuery() / useActionMutation()
        -> Server Action
```

## Rule of thumb

- Components never call actions directly.
- Components call hooks.
- Hooks call ZapAction hooks.
- Server actions stay server-only.
