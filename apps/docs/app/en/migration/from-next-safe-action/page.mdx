# Migration: From next-safe-action

## Practical mapping

- Keep your server actions.
- Introduce `defineAction` incrementally.
- Add feature keys and tags per module.
- Connect read paths with `useActionQuery`.
- Connect write paths with `useActionMutation`.

This path works feature-by-feature without a full rewrite.
