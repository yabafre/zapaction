# Migration: From ZSA

| ZSA | ZapAction |
| --- | --- |
| `setupServerActionHooks` | not required |
| global key factory | `createFeatureKeys` |
| manual invalidation | tags + registry |

## Suggested migration order

1. Move one feature to `createFeatureKeys`
2. Keep existing actions and add tags
3. Swap hooks feature-by-feature
