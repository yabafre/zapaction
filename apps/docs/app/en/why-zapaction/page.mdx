# Why ZapAction

ZapAction is optimized for teams already using Next.js Server Actions and TanStack Query.

## Key differences

| Topic | Typical setup | ZapAction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Action contract | split across multiple files | one typed action contract |
| Query keys | ad-hoc arrays | feature-scoped helpers |
| Invalidation | manual per mutation | tags and registry by default |
| Project structure | route-driven sprawl | feature-first modules |
