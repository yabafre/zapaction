# Introduction

ZapAction is a typed contract layer for **Next.js Server Actions** and **TanStack Query**.

## What you get

- Runtime validation for input and output with Zod.
- Shared cache invalidation model between server and client.
- Query key and cache tag helpers for predictable data flows.
- React hooks that keep loading, success, and error states explicit.

## Mental model

1. `defineAction` is the source of truth for action contracts.
2. `setActionContext` injects request context on the server.
3. `useActionQuery` is for reads and enforces `readPolicy: "read-only"`.
4. `useActionMutation` is for writes and tag-based invalidation.

## Suggested path

1. Start with [Project Setup](/en/guide/project-setup).
2. Continue with [React Query](/en/guide/react-query).
3. Validate behavior in [Testing Patterns](/en/guide/testing-patterns).
4. Reuse the [Full CRUD Example](/en/examples/full-crud).
