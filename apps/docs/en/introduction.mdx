# Introduction

ZapAction is a typed contract layer for **Next.js Server Actions** and **TanStack Query**.

## What you get

- Input/output validation with `defineAction` and Zod
- Predictable query keys and cache tags
- Shared cache invalidation model across server and client
- Clean adoption path for teams

## Suggested path

1. Start with **Project Setup**
2. Move to **React Query** integration
3. Validate with **Testing Patterns**
4. Use the **Full CRUD** example as reference
